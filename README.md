# 3D Animation React Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal React portfolio site built with Three.js. 

It has an interactive 3D animation that changes as you scroll down the page, to create an awesome transition between sections.
This was done using InstancedMesh in Three.js with custom vertex and fragment shaders.
Additional features include:
- Custom cards with Tilt, hover effects, and a unique carousel of text animation.
- Transition bubble animations between the main page and sections.
- Unique animated typing-style header.
