# 3D Animation React Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal React portfolio site built with Three.js. 

It has 3D animation that changes as you scroll down the page, to create an awesome transition between sections.
This was done using InstancedMesh in Three.js with custom vertex and fragment shaders.

- Made by Byron.
