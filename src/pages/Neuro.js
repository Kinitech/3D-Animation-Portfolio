                    <h2>Comparative Pain Capacity of Animals in Agriculture</h2>
                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>The capacity for pain is an essential determinant for devising animal welfare standards for the avoidance of suffering. Welfare standards for fish are absent; however, the evidence in favour for fish pain capacity is mounting. This research review compares the potential for the experience of pain in animals commonly used in agriculture, namely pigs, chickens, and fish, with a focus on the treatment of fish compared to the other two species. The review examines neuroanatomy, electrophysiological activity, pharmacological response, and both short-term and long-term behavioural responses to pain in these species, as well as their relative ethical agricultural policies. The aim of the review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on pain in these animals, and to explore the implications of these findings for ethical decision-making in the treatment of fish in agriculture. Specifically, the aim is to determine whether the discrepancy in the welfare of fish aligns with the latest pain research. The review highlights evidence for similarities and differences between fish and other animals in their experience of pain and discusses the potential mechanisms underlying these differences. The conclusions of the review have important implications for tackling more effective pain management strategies for fish, and for the broader ethical considerations surrounding the treatment of fish.</p>
